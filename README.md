# Redux Assessment

To get started, fork this project to your own repository. Then give your proctor access to it so they can assess your progress.

For this assessment you will be given a task from STORIES.md and a branch to start from. Each story consists of three parts:
- Test Writing
- Coding
- Styling

Depending on what you are being tested on you may be asked to perform a single part, or all parts. Our standard development practice is to have a single branch for each story, however for the purpose of this assessment make a new branch for each part to make it easier to evaluate. After you are finished with a part make a pull request.

Don't assume that the branch you are given is state of the art. If you see anything that should be improved upon please let us know!

Use this [React Style Guide](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/React-Style-Guide) for consistency.

Composites can be found [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/DAUAYG5TMQW#/screens) to give you an idea of what we are going for. It needs to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

You may use any resource you have at your disposal to accomplish the tasks, so long as you understand what it is you are doing (no blind copy pasta!)
